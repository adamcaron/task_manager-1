## Task Manager

Simple task manager app built with Sinatra. 
Some of the code is annotated for future reference and some files, in particular `task_manager/app/models/task_manager.rb`, contain commented out code. Task Manager started as a plain Siantra app using `YAML::Store` as its database but was iterated on to include Capybara and SQL and sequel - hence the comments.
